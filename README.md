# Blue Cross Pets CLI

This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view all of the adoptable dogs and cats on the Blue Cross Pets (UK) website.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'blue_cross_pets'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install blue_cross_pets

The blue_cross_pets CLI will be installed; you can then run `blue_cross_pets` to access Blue Cross UK's adoptable dogs and cats in your command line.

## Usage

Run `blue_cross_pets` after installing the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle exec bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bundle exec bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To run the development version of the CLI run `bundle exec bin/blue_cross_pets.`
